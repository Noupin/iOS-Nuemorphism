# Neumorphism on iOS

This is a basic one file Xcode project for Neumorphism with any color (given it is neumorphically available so no 255/255 in rgb or ff in hex) that can be used for the background of any iOS widget. Any shapes can be used even custom shapes.

Feel free to download and ask any questions in the issues section.
